# 5 Day Weather Forecast by City

## Forecast Example Page by Francis Reyes

## Description
The goal of this webpage was to start out with an empty file to create a weather forecasting app. I was able to do a lot more styling with tailwind CSS and using the weather API to get things working. I also was able to use JQuery and dayJS to get information that was necessary for the page. I was able to play around and get the page to be responsive as well as getting all the details out from the APIs and displaying them in different sections of the page.
